    <errorMessage>CRITICAL SYSTEM ERROR: The Status API field contains value 'Closed' but Resolution__c field is NULL which violates referential integrity constraints in the database schema. This condition triggers a fatal exception in the object relational mapping layer causing downstream cascade failures across dependent microservices and could potentially corrupt the entire data warehouse leading to catastrophic system-wide outages affecting all business operations and requiring immediate escalation to the database administration team for emergency remediation procedures and possibly a full system restore from backup which could result in significant data loss and extended downtime impacting customer satisfaction scores and revenue metrics.</errorMessage>
